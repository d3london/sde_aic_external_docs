### OMOP CDM 5.4 - OMOP.DRUG_EXPOSURE
This table captures records about the exposure to a Drug ingested or otherwise introduced into the body. A Drug is a biochemical substance formulated in such a way that when administered to a Person it will exert a certain biochemical effect on the metabolism. Drugs include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as Drugs.

### IMPLEMENTATION - SILVER.DRUG_EXPOSURE

SILVER.DRUG_EXPOSURE is the cleaned and transformed version of ingested drug prescription, administration and/or dispensing tables, that are used to stage vanilla OMOP CDM 5.4 tables (as well as other GOLD transformations). This table is wider than the OMOP data model, and includes the following differences:

- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- Source concept codes/names are surfaced to enable direct visibility over semantic provenance;
- Dose information from source NHS inpatient drug adminstration systems (or 'drug charts') are difficult to represent unambiguously in OMOP. For example, OMOP quantity may contain 'number of tablets' OR 'dose' OR 'total dosage given'. In the NHS, administration records found in drug charts are often a drug name (e.g. Paracetamol) and a dose (e.g. 1g) without any information about medication formulation or strength, which is the preferred information held in a standard OMOP concept. SILVER.DRUG_EXPOSURE therefore explicitly differentiates between item strength and quantity, and prescribed/administered dose.
- SILVER.DRUG_EXPOSURE also includes a column to indicate whether a prescribed dose was administered at the time, or if the dose was 'not given' at the prescribed time.
- OMOP is unable to capture details about complex infusions, for example those given on intensive care units, where a particular start or end time of an exposure may correspond to an infusion given at a specific dose unit (e.g. amount per weight) and a rate (e.g. volume per time). An additional column is included to represent this information.    
- Each row holds information about a single concept relative to a single person. We can therefore incorporate additional, NHS-specific, information about table and systems provenance relative to source data. By extension, this allows for additional understanding of context of data generation, whereas it is often necessary to infer 'OMOP drug type'.
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are initialised, but set as null, and remain empty when carried into OMOP.CONDITION_OCCURRENCE.
