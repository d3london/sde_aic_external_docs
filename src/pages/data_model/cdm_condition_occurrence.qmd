## CONDITION_OCCURRENCE

### source.{source_table} (BRONZE)

Structured data sources for patient diagnoses, and observed signs and notable symptoms will generally always include:

| Table                                  | Type            |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Commissioning Datasets                 | Legacy + Live          |
| Clinical Coding activity outputs | Legacy + Live          |
| Electronic health record system problem lists | Legacy + Live  |

Tables are loaded to the database in batches, or through incremental ingestion via connection to a source database.

### bronze.base_ or stg_{source}__{entity} (BRONZE)

Data sources are staged as `stg_{source}__{entity}` (if necessary, with an initial step of `base_{source}__{entity}` prior to unioning). This may include column renaming and edge case handling.

### silver.int_condition_occurrence (SILVER)

Different data sources are UNIONED into a minimum common dataset for representing the occurrence of conditions, and attached, relevant qualifiers. This table does not contain data from specialty systems such as cancer, which may have additional diagnostic qualifiers.

Diagnosis codes are attached to a particular patient. Patients must first be assigned a `person_uuid`, which is given to the relevant diagnosis in this intermediate stage.

Diagnosis codes may be attached to a particular hospital admission or attendance. These `spells` or `attendances` must first be assigned a `visit_occurrence_id`, which is given to the relevant diagnosis.

    }
```

### silver.ext_condition_occurrence (SILVER)

This is the transformed version of ingested condition tables.  Concepts in this table are mapped to OMOP standards, and column naming is compatible, but it contains the following differences:

- Standardised concept codes/names are surfaced, and indexed, to enable user-friendly exploration and visualisation without the need for large joins;
- OMOP CDM 5.4 columns that are not relevant to the NHS, or to intended purposes, are excluded. When converting to vanilla OMOP, these columns remain empty;
- Source, table, and systems provenance are maintained;
- Systems source is mapped to `condition_type_concept_id` per OMOP.

### omop.condition_occurrence (GOLD, OMOP CDM 5.4)

This table contains records of Events of a Person suggesting the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or a symptom, which is either observed by a Provider or reported by the patient. The canonical OMOP table is shown below.

        condition_occurrence_id integer "[PK not null] autogenerated identifier"

        condition_status_concept_id integer "how diagnosis was made - e.g. admission vs final"
        stop_reason varchar20 "why condition is no longer valid"
        provider_id integer "[FK] clinician provider who recorded condition"
